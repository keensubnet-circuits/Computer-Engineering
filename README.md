# Computer-Engineering

This is a repository for laboratory and lecture materials contributed by faculty members from the KEEN network in the area of Digital Electronics and Computer Engineering. The goal is to contribute course materials containing aspects of entrepreneurially minded learning (EML) so that other faculty members can use materials in their courses.
